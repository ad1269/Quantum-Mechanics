# Quantum Mechanics

<h3>Details</h3>
This code calculates the movement of an electron as it hits a potential energy barrier. Since in quantum mechanics, it's impossible to know the exact position of a particle, the position is stored as a probability. Running the script creates a gif of the changing position probability over time. This is calculated using the Schrodinger Wavefunction.

<h3>Running the Project</h3>
To run the project yourself, you must change the path variable in main.c to the root directory of the project. Then delete the contents of Well, so that the script can generate new data files. Once you've run main.c (takes about 2 minutes), run plot.sh to generate a gif of the process.

<h3>Example</h3>
Output.gif was produced by this program. In this gif, a strong potential energy barrier is positioned at x = 12000. The electron position collides into this barrier and gets reflected backwards.
