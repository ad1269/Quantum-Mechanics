# Quantum Mechanics

<h3>Details</h3>
This code calculates the movement of an electron as it hits a potential energy barrier. Since in quantum mechanics, it's impossible to know the exact position of a particle, the position is stored as a probability. Running the script creates a gif of the changing position probability over time. This is calculated using the Schrodinger Wavefunction. Output.gif was produced by this program.

<h3>Running the Project</h3>
To run the project yourself, you must change the path variable in main.c to the root directory of the project. Then delete the contents of Well, so that the script can generate new data files. Once you've run main.c (takes about 2 minutes), run plot.sh to generate a gif of the process.
